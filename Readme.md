# Project #5. Crypto Star DAPP on Ethereun

This is Project 5, Crypto Star DAPP on Eherun. In this project I created a DAPP that allows token creation and exchange using the ERC-721 Token interface.

## Additional Information:

1. Truffle v5.0.2
2. OpenZeppelin v2.1.2
3. Token Name: Rafael Moreira Token
4. Token Symbol: RMT
5. Token Address on Rinkeby: 0x0bb1eba3db503D04F1f04b1D9874b7c0A7E3752f


## What do I learned with this Project

* I was able to understand how fungible and non fungible tokens work on Ethereum.
* I learned how to use truffle and how to take advantage of the boilerplate code provided in the available truffle boxes.
* I learned how to deploy a DAPP to the Rinkeby network and find it in the Rinkeby Etherscan.
